			<!-- <h1>Interests</h1> -->
			<p>I am a recent graduate of the Bachelor of Computational Design and Interior Architecture (Honours) at the University of New South Wales.
				 I have skills in 3D modelling, digital & graphic design, basic web-development languages (Python, CSS, HTML), technical drafting, design thinking and project management.
				 I have a strong passion for User Experience and User Interface design, as I have always been fascinated by the influence of behavioural psychology on the digital sector and how emerging technologies can transform 
				 the lives of businesses and the wider community today.
			</p>
			<blockquote>I hope to pursue a career in UX/UI design and solve challenging business issues through innovative design solutions.</blockquote>
			<!-- <img src="images/about-img.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="About"> -->
			<p><strong>I am currently looking for a full time graduate position at a company with a digital team, so feel free to contact me for any job opportunities at <u>kartinleung@gmail.com</u>!</strong></p>

			<h1>Education</h1>

			<p>
				In 2015, I pursued a Bachelor of Interior Architecture (Honours) at UNSW due to my passion for spatial and human centred design. 
				I learnt how to design spaces focusing on function and form, as well as working with new and heritage listed buildings, large scale spaces, rooms, furnitures and fixtures. 
				This degree gave me the opportunity to create personal and intimate experiences for users 
				through theoretical research and understanding human behaviour. I also learnt about a building's structural components and documentation drafting which helped to significantly reduce the gap between creative design and the technicality behind it. 
				<br>
				<br>
				In 2019, I decided to further my studies by pursing a Bachelor of Computational Design also at UNSW. 
				This course provided the stepping stone for my interest in digital and design. 
				I witnessed firsthand how technology transforms the way we design and how it can transform everyday life as well. 
				Computational design provided the complementary technological skills which enabled me to design efficiently and effectively. 
				I was able to master 3D modelling software programs and web development languages during my studies and in my thesis project. </p>
  
			  <h1>Work Experience</h1>
			  <p>In 2019, I obtained a summer internship at Binyan Studios, one of Australia's largest 3D architectural visualisation firm. I was fortunate to be able to learn 
				  essential 3D modelling skills, as well as gain exposure to 3D artistry and project management.
				  
				  From 2017, I was working as a junior project manager at Unique Carpentry & Shopfitting, a small scale construction firm specialising in retail and carpentry work. 
				  I assisted with overseeing project contracts and paperwork, as well as the sourcing and purchasing of materials and email correspondence with strata managers, facilities managers, clients and material suppliers.
			  </p>
  
			  <h1>Academic Achievements</h1>
			  <p>In 2018, my team and I were awarded 3rd Place for our app design for the UNSW Women In Technology Hackathon hosted by Microsoft.
				  
				  In 2020, I was awarded the UNSW Built Environment Dean's Merit List Award for my academic performance during the year of 2019 which places me in the top 5% of the faculty.</p>
  
			  <h1>Extracurricular Activities</h1>
			  <p>I have been a part of many university societies and held leadership roles during my time at university. I was involved in UNSW Fashion and Beauty Society,
				  UNSW Save the Children Action Group, UNSW CREATE, UNSW Food Lovers Society and UNSW Built Environment Student Association.
			  
				  Outside of university, I enjoy playing basketball and touch football in local social competitions.</p>
